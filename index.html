            <h2>Private variables and methods</h2>

            <p>
                Galaxy has one standard of technical controll so functions which validate spaceship
                by it's current characteristics is private and can not be modified outside.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>point</strong> is local variable and visible just inside constructor.
                <strong>quolityControll</strong> - is private method and it has no access outside constructor.
            </p>
            <p>* JavaScript can't make method or property protected that is why fake can be created. Ship with fake
            quolityControll method automaticaly become out of law.</p>

        <h1>Battleship Constructor</h1>
        <p>
            In civilized galaxy - star ship is pretty regular think. It was constructed 2 320 years ago by team from
            Imperial Engineers Academy. They have been developed based construction and functionality for 350 years.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, it would be stupid to ignore this part of ready to use methods in production
            so was created base constructor for all ships in our galaxy, it is named - Battelship.
        </p>
        <p>
            Later we will create with this constructor different space ships.
